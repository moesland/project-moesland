# Backend Project
This is the backend application for a monolithic stack built with Node.js and Express. It serves as the primary interface for other applications in the stack to make API calls.

## getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the server or run `npm run dev` to auto refresh for debugging.
3. Run `npm install bcrypt` to install package for hashing password value of user.

Once the server is running, you should be able to access it at __port 5000__.

## API Documentation
For detailed documentation of the API, please see the documentation (*COMMING SOON*).
